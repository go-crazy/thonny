# [4.1.3]
# 我想说谢谢

我是一个教育和技术的从业者，一个普通有梦想的人！
我希望我们可以一起构建好用的Thonny！
Thonny很优秀，但是很多人们不希望学习带着政治色彩，人们希望安装包可以更加的快速，所以我们镜像了Thonny,给需要的人们，我们没有恶意，仅此而已！
慢慢来！

我们还是要感谢Thonny，感谢社区的开源伙伴，我们会一直尽可能保持和主版本的功能的一致性！谢谢你们，请你们理解！

##[GPT4]I want to say thank you.

I am an educator and tech practitioner, just an ordinary person with dreams! 
I hope together, we can build an efficient Thonny!
Thonny is incredible, but many people prefer not to let learning be influenced by politics. They hope for faster installation packages, which is why we mirrored Thonny for those who need it. We have no ill intentions, just that!
Let's take it slow!

We still have to extend our gratitude to Thonny and the open-source partners in the community. We will continuously strive to sustain compatibility with the main version's functionality! Thank you, and we seek your understanding!
